Loves: The Gym, Meditation, Crypto, Podcasts.

  Really love meeting and talking to people but up to a point, kind of a weird extroverted introvert, My dreams as of this year are to open a startup
 called Uranium 235, and it will focus mostly on websites, Mobile and Desktop Apps, and blockchains. I learn mainly by practice and I really am trying to 
 contribute to open source projects to improve my coding skills.
